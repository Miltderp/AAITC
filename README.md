This was my Senior Project completed under Siemens Energy. We designed and implement an IOS application that allowed users to identify parts and place them into 
corresponding datasheets to help improve accuracy as well reduce time to identify parts. 


NOTE* We are under NDA so these images are not the actual application, nor can we share the code.
